# Recipes App

This was a group project in which we developed a recipe app working with agile methodologies and using the most modern features of the React ecosystem: Hooks and Context API!

Here you will be able to see, search, filter, favorite and follow the process of preparing recipes and drinks!

The database used 2 distinct APIs, one for food and another for drinks.

The layout is focused on mobile devices.
